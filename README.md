TO-DO LIST APPLICATION 

Main Application Window: The Tk object is created, configured, and the task list is initialized.
openTaskFile Function: Reads tasks from a file and adds them to the listbox.
UI Elements: Icons, labels, frames, buttons, listboxes, and scrollbars are created and placed using the place geometry manager where necessary.
Add Task Function: Adds a task to the listbox and clears the entry field.
Delete Task Function: Deletes the selected task from both the listbox and the internal task list.
This code should now work without errors, providing a functional To-Do list application.

CALCULATOR APPLICATION

User Input:
The user is prompted to enter two numbers.
The user is then asked to choose an operation by entering a number between 1 and 4.
Operation Execution:
Depending on the user's choice, the corresponding arithmetic function is called.
The result is displayed to the user.

The divide function includes a check to prevent division by zero.

PASSWORD GENERATOR 

Character Set: The script uses a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters to generate the password. This is done using the string module.
User Input: The user is prompted to specify the length of the password. The script validates that the input is a positive integer.
Password Generation: The password is generated using the random.choice() function, which picks random characters from the defined set until the desired length is reached.
Output: The generated password is printed on the screen.

ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS
